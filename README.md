# WK Vocab Parts of Speech

A collection of scripts to determine a breakdown on the quantity of items per part of speech.
Currently only the scripts for data collection, arrangement, and analysis.
Depending on community response I may add a webapp for tracking user progress, but I think that functionality might be better suited in rfindley's stats site.
